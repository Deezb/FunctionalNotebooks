Created a repo folder in the google drive shared folder called
 CompSciProject/share      which is to keep our zeppelins synced.  

to download the image and run it as a container enter the following

docker run -itd -p 8080:8080 -v (replace with your local google share reference):/usr/zeppelin/Notebook deezb/zeppy3

this will download and create the container and share the folders and ports
then you need to run "docker ps" and take the first 4 digits of the container id

docker exec -it (first4 digits) /bin/bash
to get into the linux bash shell, 

./bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh start
gets the zeppelin server up and running.

in a web browser goto localhost:8080

If you have notebooks in other zepps, open the notebook in your zepp, click on export and save the json, then goto the main page of this zepp and import the json
